    "introduction": "Welcome to the Engineering Physics Virtual Lab. This lab is developed as a set of software modules to conduct physics laboratory experiments virtually. These experiments aim to replicate the hands-on experience of a real laboratory through interactive simulations, observations and graphs. Designed to be accessible via the internet, these experiments cater to a wide audience beyond the traditional classroom setting. The virtual lab covers a broad range of fundamental and modern physics experiments, including optics, quantum mechanics, electromagnetism, and semiconductor physics. Students can explore wave optics through interference and diffraction experiments, study semiconductor devices like diodes and transistors, and analyze quantum phenomena such as Planck’s constant and Hall Effect. These experiments provide a structured, engaging, and concept-driven learning experience, helping students develop a strong foundation in physics with the flexibility of remote experimentation.",
